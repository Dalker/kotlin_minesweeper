#+TITLE: Minesweeper Kotlin Learning Project
#+AUTHOR: Daniel Kessler (a.k.a. Dalker)

This little project was made while following the [[https://hyperskill.org][HyperSkill]] introductory Kotlin
course and following their specifications. The originality in this personal
implementation, not requested by the course, was to try and implement a proper
MVC approach to tackle the problem. In other words, this toy project has helped
me learn and practice some basic Kotlin as well as practice implementing a
simple CLI-based MVC framework.

If the sources are cloned on a local *nix machine, they can be compiled on the
command line into a =jar= file as
#+begin_src bash
kotlinc *.kt -include-runtime -d minesweeper.jar
#+end_src
That =jar= file may then be executed with the following command:
#+begin_src bash
java -jar minesweeper.jar
#+end_src
